Saxsdmerge
~~~~~~~~~~

This Tool adresses a very specific problem only aplicable under our special needs.

.. command-output:: saxsdmerge --help

What it does is the following. It merges the two logfiles
by interpolating the   1 sec interval dataloger at the shutter event times. 
The interpolation method takes the closest previous entry. The two logfiles are presumed 
to have the same clock. This data is then merged with the data 
extracted from the image headers and written to a ouput file as a Table.
