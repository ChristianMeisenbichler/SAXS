.. _saxsdog:

The Saxsdog
~~~~~~~~~~~

The saxsdog is a script that converts directories with images to curves. 
It can use multiple threads and watch the file system for changes.
  
For Help on the usage type:

.. command-output:: saxsdog --help 
  
The calibration file must be a valid :ref:`root`
 
.. _converter:

The Converter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The converter extracts information from the calibration.txt generated by fit2d 
and adds them to a SAXS.calibration configuration file. (:ref:`root`)
 
.. command-output:: saxsconverter  --help

If there is a  target file   and it is a valid :ref:`root`, the parsed values are added or updated in place.

.. _plotchi:

Plotchi
~~~~~~~

The tool "plotchi"  plots a list of ".chi"-files:

.. command-output:: plotchi  --help 

Saxsdmerge
~~~~~~~~~~

This tool adresses a very specific problem only aplicable under our groups needs.

.. command-output:: saxsdmerge --help

What it does is the following: It merges the two logfiles
by interpolating the 1 sec interval dataloger at the shutter event times. 
The interpolation method takes the closest previous entry. The two logfiles are presumed 
to have the same clock. This data is then merged with the data 
extracted from the image headers and written to a ouput file as a Table.
As the image timestaps are from a different clock which might have a significant 
offset, the ``-1`` and ``-t`` options allow for dealing with that. 
In order to check if the time syncronisation is reasonable, the tool displays a 
graph with the shutter times and the exposure times from the images.

At the moment it works only with Pilatus 1M image data.
